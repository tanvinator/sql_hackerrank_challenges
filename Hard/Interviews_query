Samantha interviews many candidates from different colleges using coding challenges and contests. 
Write a query to print the contest_id, hacker_id, name, and the sums of total_submissions, total_accepted_submissions, total_views, 
and total_unique_views for each contest sorted by contest_id. Exclude the contest from the result if all four sums are 0.

Input Format
The following tables hold interview data:

    Contests: The contest_id is the id of the contest, hacker_id is the id of the hacker who created the contest, and name is the name of the hacker.
    
    Colleges: The college_id is the id of the college, and contest_id is the id of the contest that Samantha used to screen the candidates. 
    
    Challenges: The challenge_id is the id of the challenge that belongs to one of the contests whose contest_id Samantha forgot, and college_id is the 
                id of the college where the challenge was given to candidates. 
    View_Stats: The challenge_id is the id of the challenge, total_views is the number of times the challenge was viewed by candidates, and 
                total_unique_views is the number of times the challenge was viewed by unique candidates. 
    Submission_Stats: The challenge_id is the id of the challenge, total_submissions is the number of submissions for the challenge, and 
                      total_accepted_submission is the number of submissions that achieved full scores.

Note: A specific contest can be used to screen candidates at more than one college, but each college only holds 1 screening contest.
